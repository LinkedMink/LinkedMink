# Public Keys

I sign and/or encrypt my messages when appropriate and will keep shared public keys in this repo. All
my keys have been certified with a [key](keys/harlan.sang@linkedmink.net.gpg) not linked to my private
email addresses to keep them private. If you can trust that the key file belongs to me, you can also
trust the listed key fingerprints also belong to me. Note that I normally don't check messages sent
to the domain linkedmink.net.
