# Harlan Sang

Hi, :wave: I'm a developer based out of the Dallas / Fort Worth area with a day job. I've long been
interested in the open source model, but I have only recently started posting projects that might be
useful enough to share. If you have suggestions for improvements or would like to make modifications
feel free to reach out.

## Contact

Create an issue or contribute to a discussion to get in touch about projects. I often sign private
messages, so see my [key fingerprints](keys) to verify.
