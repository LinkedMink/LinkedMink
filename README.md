# Harlan Sang

Hi, :wave: I'm a developer based out of the Dallas / Fort Worth area with a day job. I've long been
interested in the open source model, but I have only recently started posting projects that might be
useful enough to share. If you have suggestions for improvements or would like to make modifications
feel free to reach out.

## Public Keys

I sign and/or encrypt my messages when appropriate and will keep shared public keys in this repo. All
my keys have been certified with a [key](keys/harlan.sang@linkedmink.net.gpg) not linked to my private 
email addresses to keep them private. If you can trust that the key file belongs to me, you can also
trust the listed key fingerprints also belong to me. Note that I normally don't check messages sent
to the domain linkedmink.net.
